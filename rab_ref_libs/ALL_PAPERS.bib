  abstract = {We consider an algorithm for the reduction of a given finite multigraph Γ to
canonical form. Therein the new invariant of a graph appears — the algebra A(Γ). The
study of properties of the algebra A(Γ) turns out to be helpful in solving a number of
graph-theoretic problems. We pose and discuss some conjectures on the relation between
properties of the algebra A(Γ) and the automorphism group Aut(Γ) of a graph Γ. We give
an example of undirected graph Γ whose algebra A(Γ) coincides with the group algebra of
some noncommutative group.},

to correctly assign chemical compounds to various classes or to retrieve potential drug-like
compounds has been an active area of research. Many of the best-performing techniques for
these tasks utilize a descriptor-based representation of the compound that captures various
aspects of the underlying molecular graph’s topology. In this paper we compare five dif-
ferent set of descriptors that are currently used for chemical compound classification. We
also introduce four different descriptors derived from all connected fragments present in the
molecular graphs primarily for the purpose of comparing them to the currently used des-
criptor spaces and analyzing what properties of descriptor spaces are helpful in providing
effective representation for molecular graphs. In addition, we introduce an extension to exis-
ting vector-based kernel functions to take into account the length of the fragments present
in the descriptors. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the previously introduced
and the new descriptors in the context of SVM-based classification and ranked-retrieval on
28 classification and retrieval problems derived from 18 datasets. Our experiments show that
for both of these tasks, two of the four descriptors introduced in this paper along with the
extended connectivity fingerprint based descriptors consistently and statistically outperform
previously developed schemes based on the widely used fingerprint- and Maccs keys-based
descriptors, as well as recently introduced descriptors obtained by mining and analyzing the
structure of the molecular graphs.},

Ramon and Gärtner (Proceedings of the first international workshop on mining graphs, trees

complexity of the subtrees used as features to represent the graphs. This parameter allows to
smoothly interpolate between classical graph kernels based on the count of common walks,
on the one hand, and kernels that emphasize the detection of large common subtrees, on the
other hand. We also propose two modular extensions to this formulation. The first extension
increases the number of subtrees that define the feature space, and the second one removes
noisy features from the graph representations. We validate experimentally these new kernels
on problems of toxicity and anti-cancer activity prediction for small molecules with support
vector machines.},

  abstract  = {Semi-supervised clustering algorithms aim to improve clustering results using
limited supervision. The supervision is generally given as pairwise constraints; such con-
straints are natural for graphs, yet most semi-supervised clustering algorithms are designed
for data represented as vectors. In this paper, we unify vector-based and graph-based ap-
proaches. We first show that a recently-proposed objective function for semi-supervised
clustering based on Hidden Markov Random Fields, with squared Euclidean distance and
a certain class of constraint penalty functions, can be expressed as a special case of the
weighted kernel k-means objective (Dhillon et al., in Proceedings of the 10th International
Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2004a). A recent theoretical con-
nection between weighted kernel k-means and several graph clustering objectives enables
us to perform semi-supervised clustering of data given either as vectors or as a graph. For
graph data, this result leads to algorithms for optimizing several new semi-supervised graph
clustering objectives. For vector data, the kernel approach also enables us to find clusters
with non-linear boundaries in the input data space. Furthermore, we show that recent work
on spectral learning (Kamvar et al., in Proceedings of the 17th International Joint Confer-
ence on Artificial Intelligence, 2003) may be viewed as a special case of our formulation.
We empirically show that our algorithm is able to outperform current state-of-the-art semi-
supervised algorithms on both vector-based and graph-based data sets.},

models were proposed such as the one by Crammer and Singer (J Mach Learn Res

problem is the product of the number of samples (l) by the number of classes
(k), which produces a large computational complexity. This chapter sorts the
existing classical techniques for multi-class SVM into the indirect and direct ones
and further gives the comparison for them in terms of theory and experiments.
Especially, this chapter exhibits a new Simplified Multi-class SVM (SimMSVM)
that reduces the size of the resulting dual problem from l × k to l by introducing
a relaxed classification error bound. The experimental discussion demonstrates
that the SimMSVM approach can greatly speed up the training process, while
maintaining a competitive classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {Naturally, graph structured data is not easy to learn from. As
opposed to itemsets which can be represented by a table of fixed length,
there is no obvious representation language for graphs which allows for
an easy similarity measure in order to perform e.g. classification tasks on
sets of graphs. There have been introduced numerous graph kernels which
tackle the problem of defining a suitable similarity between graphs by
incorporating structural information. In this article, however, we revert
to the very simplistic approach which is to regard a graph as a (multi-
) itemset made up of node and edge labels. We consider our method
as a baseline and compare it to several established graph kernels on a
wide range of benchmark datasets. Our observations suggest that for the
overwhelming number of available datasets, actually utilizing the graphs’
structure in graph kernels does not significantly improve the classification
accuracy.},

embeddings and structural graph representations, bridging methods like matrix
factorization and graph neural networks. Using invariant theory, we show that
the relationship between structural representations and node embeddings is anal-
ogous to that of a distribution and its samples. We prove that all tasks that can
be performed by node embeddings can also be performed by structural represen-
tations and vice-versa. We also show that the concept of transductive and induc-
tive learning is unrelated to node embeddings and graph representations, clearing
another source of confusion in the literature. Finally, we introduce new practi-
cal guidelines to generating and using node embeddings, which fixes significant
shortcomings of standard operating procedures used today.},
